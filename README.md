# Mac-Address Change
Hackers may change MAC addresses for various reasons, including enhancing privacy, bypassing network restrictions, and conducting unauthorized activities. However, it's important to note that changing a MAC address for malicious purposes is unethical and illegal. MAC address spoofing should only be done for legitimate and legal purposes, such as network testing, security research, or privacy protection.
